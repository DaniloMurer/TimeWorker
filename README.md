# TimeWorker

Time Worker is an application written in C++ for measuring your times for your tasks.

The first version of this application will only be CLI based.

The second version will be extenden with a GUI using wxWidget.

The third and (hopefully) last version will be implementing some sort of batch system.

## Want to contribute?

If you want to contribute to this repository there is no need to have any experience in C++, as far as I am concerned I don't have much experience either :).

All issues and the general development can be followed inside the project from the TimeWorker Repository.
